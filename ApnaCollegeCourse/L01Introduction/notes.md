## Code (Need of code)
Our electronic devices cant understand hindi or english, thay can only understand binary language.
Now its difficult to comunicate with binary codes, so here comes the concept of <b>High Level Language</b>
### High Level Language
High level languages such as java, c++ are such languages taht provide the users an easier way to communicate with the computer properly structured with the help of syntaxes and other block
### Compiler
Every language has its own compiler that compiles the high level language and converts it into <b>Binary Codes</b>

## How is my Java Code running
It goes through 2 steps:
- compilation
- execution

JDK: Java Developement Kit
JRE: Java Runtime Environment
JVM: Java Virtual Machine

### Byte Code
It is the output given by the java compiler. Now this byte code can be executes on any of the patform, whether it is windows, linux or mac
This is one of the reasons why Java is called a portable language

#### Java Virtual Machine with Byte code
now the JVM takes the byte code produced by the compiler and converts it into Native code, native code can be defined as the code that the native mmachine can understand

## Components of the code
- Function
All the codes in Java are written inside functions
- Class
All the functions are defined
